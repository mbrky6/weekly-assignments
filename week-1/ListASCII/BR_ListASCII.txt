E: Program lists out ASCII characters from ! to ~ with 10 characters per line and 1 space between each character.
X: Program lists the same character 9 times per line.

S1: Replace nested 'for' loop with an 'if' statement and counter variable (j).
R1: All characters display on the same line because the counter didn't count.

S2: Replace "j++" with "j += 1".
R2: Program doesn't recognize the counter.

S3: Remove j from the if statement.
R3: Nothing changed.

S4: Remove the j declaration from the 'for' loop. (Yeah, that's probably it)
R4: Only the first line is 10 characters long. All the others are 9.

S5: Replace "(j == 10)" with "(j > 10)".
R5: The first line is 11 characters now.

S6: Replace "int j = 0" with "int j = 1".
R6: Character list displays correctly.
